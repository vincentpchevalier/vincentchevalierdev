			"title": "Redis Sessions PubSub Demo",
			"description": "This project showcases lightweight, scalable session management with Redis Sets and Pub/Sub, enabling real-time communication in session-based applications. Built with Express, the application provides robust CRUD operations for session and user management. Once a session is created and joined, Pub/Sub enables real-time updates and messaging between users. The project leverages Redis for efficient data handling, with future plans to transition toward WebSockets for event-driven updates.",
